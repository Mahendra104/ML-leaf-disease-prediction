# Leaf Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model for leaf disease detection and classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images of healthy and diseased leaves. The objective is to accurately classify the health status of the leaves and provide insights into disease prevention.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle. It includes images of different plant leaves categorized into healthy and diseased types. You can download the dataset from the link below:

- **[Plant Disease Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset)**

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks containing the code for training, testing, and evaluating the machine learning model.
- `models/` - Pre-trained models and checkpoints.
- `data/` - Folder where the dataset should be stored.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.
